What is OpenJDK?

OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open source
implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE).
OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of Java SE since
version 7.

wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK

Java is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates.

How to use this image

Start a Java instance in your app

The most straightforward way to use this image is to use a Java
container as both the build and runtime environment. In your
Dockerfile, writing something along the lines of the following will
compile and run your project:

FROM openjdk:7

COPY . /usr/src/myapp

WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp

RUN javac Main.java

CMD ["java", "Main"]

You can then run and build the Docker image:

$ docker build -t my-java-app .

$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-java-app

Compile your app inside the Docker container

There may be occasions where it is not appropriate to run your app
inside a container. To compile, but not run your app inside the Docker
instance, you can write something like:

$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp openjdk:7
javac Main.java

This will add your current directory as a volume to the container, set
the working directory to the volume, and run the command javac
Main.java which will tell Java to compile the code in Main.java and
output the Java class file to Main.class.

Make JVM respect CPU and RAM limits

On startup JVM tries to detect the number of available CPU cores and
the amount of RAM to adjust its internal parameters (like the number
of garbage collector threads to spawn) accordingly. When container is
run with limited CPU/RAM, standard system API, used by JVM for
probing, will return host-wide values. This can cause excessive CPU
usage and memory allocation errors with older versions of JVM.

Inside Linux containers, recent versions of OpenJDK 8 can correctly
detect container-limited number of CPU cores by default. To enable the
detection of container-limited amount of RAM the following options can
be used:

$ java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
-XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap ...

Inside Windows Server (non-Hyper-V) containers, limit for number of
available CPU cores does not work (is ignored by Host Compute
Service). To set such limit manually, JVM can be started the following
way:

$ start /b /wait /affinity 0x3 path/to/java.exe ...

In this example CPU affinity hex mask 0x3 will limit JVM to 2 CPU
cores.

RAM limit is supported by Windows Server containers, but currently JVM
cannot detect it. To prevent excessive memory allocations,
-XX:MaxRAM=... option must be specified with the value that is not
bigger than a containers RAM limit.

Environment variables with periods in their names

Some shells (notably, the BusyBox /bin/sh included in Alpine Linux) do
not support environment variables with periods in the names (which are
technically not POSIX compliant), and thus strip them instead of
passing them through (as Bash does). If your application requires
environment variables of this form, either use CMD ["java", ...]
directly (no shell), or (install and) use Bash explicitly instead of
/bin/sh.

Image Variants

The openjdk images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific
use case.

openjdk:<version>

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs
are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both
as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the
container to start your app), as well as the base to build other
images off of.

Some of these tags may have names like jessie, sid, or stretch in
them. These are the suite code names for releases of Debian and
indicate which release the image is based on.

openjdk:<version>-alpine

This image is based on the popular Alpine Linux project, available in
the alpine official image. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most
distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images
in general.

This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as
small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does
use musl libc instead of glibc and friends, so certain software might
run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements.
However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this
variant is usually a very safe choice. See this Hacker News comment
thread for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some
pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.

To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools
(such as git or bash) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using
this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile
(see the alpine image description for examples of how to install
packages if you are unfamiliar).

openjdk:<version>-windowsservercore

This image is based on Windows Server Core
(microsoft/windowsservercore). As such, it only works in places which
that image does, such as Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise
(Anniversary Edition) or Windows Server 2016.

For information about how to get Docker running on Windows, please see
the relevant "Quick Start" guide provided by Microsoft:

Windows Server Quick Start

Windows 10 Quick Start

openjdk:<version>-slim

This image installs the -headless package of OpenJDK and so is missing
many of the UI-related Java libraries and some common packages
contained in the default tag. It only contains the minimal packages
needed to run Java. Unless you are working in an environment where
only the openjdk image will be deployed and you have space
constraints, we highly recommend using the default image of this
repository.

License

View license information for the software contained in this image.

As with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software
which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base
distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the
primary software being contained).

Some additional license information which was able to be auto-detected
might be found in the repo-info repository's openjdk/ directory.

As for any pre-built image usage, it is the image user's
responsibility to ensure that any use of this image complies with any
relevant licenses for all software contained within.
